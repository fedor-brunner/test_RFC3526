Program for searching Modular Exponential (MODP) Diffie-Hellman groups
specified in RFC 3526.

The properties of these MODP groups are described in RFC 2412.

Usage:

> python main.py

or with optimalizations:

> python -OO main.py

or with PyPy just-in-time compiler:

> pypy -OO main.py

The search should finish in couple of hours on modern PC.
